#### Why we fit only on train data?

-> fit = calculate statistics (mean, std for StandardScaler).
-> transform = apply the formula using those statistics.

Steps:
==>> fit_transform(x_train)
1.Learns mean & std from train data only.
2.Scales the train data.

==>>transform(x_test)
1.Uses the same mean & std from train.
2.Scales test data in the same way.


Why not fit on test?
Because test should act like new unseen data.
If you fit on test → you “leak” information from test into training → results won’t be fair (like cheating in exam).

Rule of thumb:
Fit only on train.
Transform both train and test using train’s parameters.
