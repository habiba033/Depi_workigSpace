### What does stratify do?
When you split your dataset into train and test, sometimes one class is much less frequent than the others (class imbalance).
=> If you use (stratify=y), the split will preserve the same class distribution in both train and test sets.


* Example:
Suppose you have a dataset with:
Class A = 80 samples
Class B = 20 samples

If you do a normal train_test_split (without stratify), you might end up with:
Train → A = 75, B = 5
Test → A = 5, B = 15
-> This is unbalanced and not representative.

If you do:
train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y)

Then both train and test will keep the 80:20 ratio:
Train → A = 64, B = 16
Test → A = 16, B = 4


=> Why is this important?

1. Prevents bias in training/testing.
2. Ensures test results are meaningful, especially in classification problems with imbalanced data.
